# Laser Beam Segmentation

To speed-up the beam characterization procedure, automatization of imprinting and imprint measurements is the main ob-
jective to be solved. Our main task is to localize the laser trace in the imprint and calculate its area and the perimeter. The algorithm should provide a reasonable segmentation of the laser trace while maintaining a low computational complexity as it will be used on simple desktop computers.
